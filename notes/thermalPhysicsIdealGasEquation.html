				<h3>Ideal Gas Equation</h3>
				<ul>
					<h4><u>Molecular and Molar Mass</u></h4>
					<li>The molecular mass of a compound is the mass of one molecule of said compound. It may be given in kilograms, but most commonly it is given as a value relative to Carbon-12. For example, carbon dioxide is made up of a carbon atom (with a relative atomic mass of 12) and two oxygen atoms (each with a relative atomic mass of 16). Therefore, the relative molecular mass of carbon dioxide is 12 + 16 + 16 = 44.</li>
					<li>The Avogadro Constant, often written as NA (often with the A in subscript), is equal to 6.02 × 10²³. A group of 6.02 × 10²³ molecules (or atoms, or any other object really) is called a mole.</li>
					<li>A single mole of a substance will have a mass in grams equal to the relative atomic/molecular mass of the substance. For example, a mole of carbon-12 atoms will have a mass of 12 grams. A mole of hydrogen gas (H₂) will have a mass of 2 grams.</li>
					<li>In equations, a number of moles may be represented with the letter n, and will use the unit mol (1 mol is a single mole of a substance).</li>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<h4><u>The Ideal Gas Equation</u></h4>
					<li>An ideal gas is one that perfectly follows Boyle's Law, Charles' Law and the Pressure Law.</li>
					<li>Boyle's Law, Charles' Law and the Pressure Law all explain the behaviour of two of the gas quantities when the third is constant. The ideal gas equation explains what happens when all three vary.</li>
					<li>The ideal gas equation states that: pressure × volume = number of moles × molar gas constant × temperature.</li>
					<li>The ideal gas equation can be explained multiple ways. One way of thinking about it is viewing it as a mix of all three gas laws. Boyle's Law states that pressure × volume = constant (when temperature is constant), Charles' Law states that volume / temperature = constant (when pressure is constant) and the Pressure Law states that pressure / temperature = constant (when volume is constant). Therefore, it stands to reason that pressure × volume / temperature should be constant.</li>
					<li>The pressure and volume of a gas are directly proportional to the number of moles of said gas - the more particles there are, the more force per unit area they will exert on a container, and the more space they will take up. For a given amount of internal energy, the temperature is inversely proportional to the number of moles. If there are fewer particles for a fixed amount of energy, each particle will get more energy, so the gas will be hotter.</li>
					<li>If pressure × volume / temperature = constant, pressure and volume are proportional to number of moles of gas and temperature is inversely proportional to the number of moles of gas, it stands to reason that pressure × volume / temperature is directly proportional to the number of moles of gas. Therefore, pressure × volume / temperature = number of moles × constant, so pressure × volume = number of moles × constant × temperature. This gives the ideal gas equation.</li>
					<li>Another way of thinking about the ideal gas equation is by starting with Boyle's Law: pressure × volume = constant at a constant temperature. This shows that the value of pressure × volume is somehow related to the temperature. We can say that pressure × volume = f(temperature), where f is a function. Since Charles' Law states that volume is directly proportional to temperature when pressure is constant, we can see that pressure × volume = constant × temperature, as volume must be directly proportional to temperature when pressure does not change (e.g. in the Charles' Law experiment). Since the pressure and volume are each proportional to the number of moles, it stands to reason that pressure × volume = number of moles × molar gas constant × temperature.</li>
					<li>The molar gas constant is equal in value to 8.31Jmol⁻¹Kg⁻¹.</li>
					<li>The ideal gas equation can also be written in terms of molecules. The number of molecules may be denoted by a capital N. The Boltzmann constant is the constant used for the ideal gas equation when number of molecules is used instead of number of moles. Its value is calculated by dividing the molar gas constant by the Avogadro Constant, and is equal to 1.38 × 10⁻²³ JKg⁻¹.</li>
					<li>Note that most gases are not "ideal gases" but follow the ideal gas equation closely enough. The ideal gas equation can only be used as an approximation for gases with relatively high temperatures and low pressures.</li>

					<h4><u>Work Done on a Gas</u></h4>
					<li>For a gas at a constant pressure, work must be done to cause the gas to expand or contract. Work is done to move gas molecules apart from each other, causing the gas to expand. When a gas contracts at a constant temperature, it means that energy has been transferred to the surroundings.</li>
					<li>According to Charles' Law, volume is directly proportional to temperature. Therefore, work is often done in the form of heating to expand a gas.</li>
					<li>An example of work being done on a gas at constant pressure is a balloon. A balloon at a fixed height will always have a constant pressure, since the balloon will always expand or contract until the pressure of the air inside is equal to the atmospheric pressure outside. Therefore, the balloon's internal pressures must be equal to the atmospheric pressure at all times. If a balloon is heated, the gas inside it will gain temperature, and thus volume (because of Charles' Law), causing the balloon to expand. If the heat source is removed, some of the internal energy of the gas will be transferred to the surroundings, and the temperature and volume of the balloon will each decrease.</li>
					<li>The work done when the volume of a gas is changed at constant temperature is equal to pressure × change in volume. This works because pressure is force per unit area and volume is equal to area × distance. Therefore, pressure × change in volume = (force / area) × (area × distance) = force × distance = work done.</li>
