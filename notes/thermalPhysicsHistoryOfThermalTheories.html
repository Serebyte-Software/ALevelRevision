				<h3>A History of Thermal Theories</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Scientific laws can be empirical or theoretical. Empirical laws are based on observations and experiental evidence, whereas theoretical laws are derived from existing knowledge.</li>
					<li>The gas laws are empirical, whereas kinetic theory is theoretcical.</li>
					<li>The Ancient Greeks and Romans were the first to propose anything similar to modern kinetic theory. The philosopher Democritus had proposed a similar idea about 2000 years ago.</li>
					<li>Robert Boyle discovered Boyle's Law in 1662.</li>
					<li>Jacques Charles discovered Charles' Law in 1787.</li>
					<li>Guillaume Amontons discovered the Pressure Law in 1699, although it was rediscovered by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac in 1809.</li>
					<li>In the 1700s, Daniel Bernoulli proposed kinetic theory to explain Boyle's Law.</li>
					<li>In 1827, Robert Brown discovered Brownian motion, which provides evidence for kinetic theory.</li>
					<li>Brownian motion describes the motion of solid particles in a fluid, for example pollen grains in water. The solid particles will move in random zig-zag paths. This is because they are being pushed constantly by the atoms in the fluid, which are too small to see.</li>
					<li>Brownian motion provides evidence that fluids are made up of atoms.</li>
					<li>Scientific ideas cannot be immediately accepted, they must be demonstrated to be correct via peer review and experimental observation. Experiments and hypotheses must be independently validated before they can be accepted.</li>
					<li>For example, Daniel Bernoulli's proposition of kinetic theory was not immediately accepted. It wasn't recognised as an accurate model of the universe until much later, when Einstein was able to use ideas of kinetic theory to predict Brownian motion that kinetic theory was fully accepted.</li>
