				<h3>"Pressure of an Ideal Gas" Equation and Kinetic Energy</h3>
				<ul>
					<h4><u>Deriving the Equation</u></h4>
					<li>The pressure of an ideal gas equation states that: pressure × volume = (1/3) × number of molecules × molecular mass × (root mean square speed)², where molecular mass is given in kilograms.</li>
					<li>The first step in deriving the pressure of an ideal gas equation is to imagine a single gas molecule striking a surface of a cubic container of length L head on (i.e. in a perpendicular direction to the surface).</li>
					<li>The second step in deriving the pressure of an ideal gas equation is to calculate the momentum of the gas molecule as mass × velocity.</li>
					<li>The third step in deriving the pressure of an ideal gas equation is to assume it bounces back elastically, with the same speed in the opposite direction. This means that the change in momentum would be -2 × mass × velocity. The change in momentum is equal to the impulse.</li>
					<li>The fourth step in deriving the pressure of an ideal gas equation is to calculate the time taken between collisions with the same wall. As the molecule moves with constant magnitude of velocity it will take length / veloctiy seconds to travel from one end of the cubic container to the other, and it will take 2 × length / velocity to travel to the other side and back - this is the time taken between collisions.</li>
					<li>The fifth step in deriving the pressure of an ideal gas equation is to calculate the average force exerted on the wall by a single molecule. This will be the same as the average force exerted on the molecule by the container, but in the reverse direction because of Newton's Third Law. Force = change in momentum / time, so we can say that the average force on the particle = (-2 × mass × velocity) / (2 * length / velocity), which simplifies to -(mass × velocity²) / length. Therefore the average force on the wall, which is of the same magnitude but in the opposite direction due to Newton's Third Law is equal to (mass × velocity²) / length.</li>
					<li>The sixth step in deriving the pressure of an ideal gas equation is to calculate the total average force on a single container wall. This can be done by multiplying the force exerted on the wall by a single molecule by the number of molecules, and using the average speed of the molecules instead of the velocity of a single molecule. This gives the equation: Force on wall = (number of molecules × mass × (average speed)²) / (length)</li>
					<li>The seventh step in deriving the pressure of an ideal gas equation is to calculate the pressure on the wall by dividing the average force on the wall by the area of the wall, since pressure = force / area. Note that area is equal to length². This gives: pressure = (number of molecules × mass × (average speed)²) / (length³). This can be simplified to pressure = (number of molecules × mass × (average speed)²) / volume.</li>
					<li>The eighth step in deriving the pressure of an ideal gas equation is to consider that the gas molecule moves in all three dimensions, and the equation only accounts for the average square speed in the dimension perpendicular to the surface of the container, and not the overall average speed of the molecule in all dimensions (which is often referred to as the root mean square speed). Using Pythagoras' Theorem we can demonstrate that the mean square speed is equal to the sum of the squares of the speeds in each dimension: C² = x² + y² + z², where C is the overall mean square speed and x, y and z are the speeds in their respective dimensions. As the speed in each dimension will be about the same on average, we can say that C² = x² + x² + x², where x is the speed in the dimension perpendicular to the surface. Therefore, C² = 3x², so the average speed perpendicular to the surface, x², is equal to (1/3) × (root mean square speed)². Therefore, in our equation we can substitute (average speed)² (which refers the the average speed in the perpendicular direction) for (1/ 3) × (root mean square speed)².</li>
					<li>The ninth step in deriving the pressure of an ideal gas equation is to write out the equation in full: pressure × volume = (1/3) × number of molecules × mass × (root mean square speed)²</li>

					<h4><u>Simplifying Assumptions</u></h4>
					<li>In real life, most gases are not ideal gases, at least not under all conditions anyway.</li>
					<li>The pressure of an ideal gas equation makes assumptions about gases. This means it can be used for approximations and averages, but not necessarily for 100% accurate values.</li>
					<li>One of the simplifying assumptions is that all molecules move about with randomly distributed speeds and directions.</li>
					<li>Another simplifying assumption is that all collisions are elastic.</li>
					<li>A third assumption is that the molecules all obey Newton's Laws.</li>
					<li>A fourth assumption is that molecules travel in straight lines and do not collide with each other, only with the walls.</li>
					<li>A fifth assumption is that the forces that act on the molecules at the surfaces last for a negligible amount of time (so that the time between the collisions is much greater than it).</li>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<h4><u>Average Kinetic Energy of a Molecule</u></h4>
					<li>By equating the ideal gas equation and the pressure of an ideal gas equation, we can calculate the average kinetic energy of a gas molecule.</li>
					<li>Using the ideal gas equation and the pressure of an ideal gas equation, we can see that pressure × volume = number of molecules × Boltzmann Constant × absolute temperature = (1/3) × number of molecules × mass of molecule × (root mean square speed)². This is the first step in deriving the equation for the average kinetic energy of a gas molecule.</li>
					<li>The second step in derving the kinetic energy of a gas molecule equation is to divide by the number of molecules on each side to get: Boltzmann Constant × absolute temperature = (1/3) × mass of molecule × (root mean square speed)².</li>
					<li>The third step in deriving the kinetic energy of a gas molecule equation is to multiply each side by 3/2 to get: (3/2) × Boltzmann Constant × absolute temperature = (1/2) × mass of molecule × (root mean square speed)². The right hand side of this is the kinetic energy of a gas molecule.</li>
					<li>Since the Boltzmann Constant is equal to the molar gas constant divided by the Avogradro constant, the kinetic energy of a gas molecule can be written as: (3 × molar gas constant × absolute temperature) / (2 × Avogadro Constant) = (1/2) × mass × (root mean square speed)².</li>
