				<h3>Energy Transfer</h3>
				<ul>
					<h4><u>Potential, Kinetic and Internal Energies</u></h4>
					<li>Thermal energy, also called heat, is the energy that a system has due to its temperature.</li>
					<li>The thermal energy of a system is related to the average kinetic energy of the particles in said system - a high temeprature is caused by particles in the system moving around and vibrating very quickly.</li>
					<li>Particles in a fluid will move with randomly distributed speeds and directions. Therefore, they will have different kinetic energies. Because of this, the temperature of the system is related to the average kinetic energy of the particles.</li>
					<li>Particles in a system also have another form of energy - potential energy. This is different to kinetic energy, since it is the energy particles have due to their position relative to one another.</li>
					<li>Particles in a substance have potential energy because they are all attracted to each other via intermolecular forces and thus work must be done to separate them. We say that this work goes into the potential store of the particles.</li>
					<li>Gases have a large amount of potential energy, liquids will have some potential energy and solids will have very little potential energy in comparison.</li>
					<li>Internal energy is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of the particles in a system.</li>
					<li>A closed system is a system in which no matter can enter or exit the system.</li>
					<li>If a system is closed, and no energy can enter or exit it, the internal energy of the system will be constant.</li>
					<li>Note that even in a closed system, particles will constantly transfer energy between their kinetic and potential stores, as they all move about and change position relative to each other. The internal energy will remain the same overall, though, provided that no energy can enter or exit the system.</li>
					<li>If work is done on a system, its internal energy will increase.</li>
					<li>If a system is allowed to cool (or energy is made to leave it via some other form), its internal energy will decrease.</li>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<h4><u>Changes of State</u></h4>
					<li>When a substance changes state, its particles gain potential energy, as they are separated further from one another.</li>
					<li>During a state change, a substance's temperature will not change. This is because the kinetic energy of the particles do not change, only the potential energy.</li>
					<li>Note that the temperature and thus kinetic energy of the particles in a substance must reach a threshold before a state change can occur, but for the duration of the state change, the temperature of the substance will not change.</li>
					<li>The energy required for an object to change state depends on the mass of the object and the material the object is made from.</li>
					<li>Specific latent heat is the amount of energy required, per unit mass, to change the state of a material.</li>
					<li>Specific latent heat gives the energy per unit mass required to change state from solid to liquid or liquid to gas, and also gives the energy per unit mass released to the surroundings when a material changes from a gas to a liquid or from a liquid to a solid.</li>
					<li>There are two different types of specific latent heat: the specific latent heat of fusion (for melting and freezing) and the specific latent heat of vaporisation (for evaporation or condensation).</li>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<h4><u>Specific Heat Capacity</u></h4>
					<li>Specific heat capacity is the energy required per unit mass to increase the temperature of a material by one degree Kelvin.</li>
					<li>Specific heat capacity is calculated using the equation: energy = mass × specific heat capacity × change in temperature.</li>
					<li>Sepcific heat capacity can be calculated via experiment. The first step involves setting up a continuous flow calorimeter with a heater, a power supply, an ammeter, a voltmeter and two thermometers.</li>
					<li>The second step of the continuous flow calorimeter experiment is to turn on the water, and then the power supply. Make sure to record the potential difference and the current.<br/><img src="./../images/continuousFlowCalorimeter.bmp" height=300px></img></li>
					<li>The third step of the continuous flow calorimeter experiment is to measure the temperature of the water flowing in, as well as the temperature of the water flowing out and use these to calculate the change in temperature.</li>
					<li>The fourth step of the continuous flow calorimeter experiment is to record the rate of water flow out of the pipe. Stop the water flow after a fixed amount of time. After stopping the experiment, calculate the input energy using current × potential difference × time - H, where H is the heat energy lost to the surroundings. Calculate the mass of water using flow rate × time.</li>
					<li>The fifth step of the continuous flow calorimeter experiment is to repeat the experiment, changing both the flow rate of the water and the power of the power supply so that the temeprature change remains constant.</li>
					<li>The sixth step of the continuous flow calorimeter experiment is to equate the two equations: Q₁ = m₁ × c ×Δθ + H, Q₂ = m₂ × c ×Δθ + H. We know the input thermal energies, the masses and the change in temperature. By subtracting the second equation from the first, we get Q₁ - Q₂ = (m₁ × c ×Δθ + H) - (m₂ × c ×Δθ + H). This simplifies to c = (Q₁ - Q₂) / (Δθ(m₁ - m₂)).</li>
