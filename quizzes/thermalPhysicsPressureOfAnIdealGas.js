		"The eighth step in deriving the pressure of an ideal gas equation is to consider that the gas molecule moves in all three dimensions, and the equation only accounts for the average square speed in the dimension ` to the surface of the container, and not the overall average speed of the molecule in all dimensions (which is often referred to as the ` ` ` speed). Using Pythagoras' Theorem we can demonstrate that the mean square speed is equal to the sum of the squares of the speeds in each dimension: C² = x² + y² + z², where C is the overall mean square speed and x, y and z are the speeds in their respective dimensions. As the speed in each dimension will be about the same on average, we can say that C² = x² + x² + x², where x is the speed in the dimension perpendicular to the surface. Therefore, C² = `x², so the average speed perpendicular to the surface, x², is equal to (1/3) × (` ` ` `)². Therefore, in our equation we can substitute (average speed)² (which refers the the average speed in the perpendicular direction) for (1 / `) × (` ` ` `)².",
